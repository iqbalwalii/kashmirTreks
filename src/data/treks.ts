    introduction: [
      "The Kashmir Great Lakes Trek is a moderate hiking trail in the western Himalayas of the Kashmir region. The base-camp Sonamarg lies on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. The ending point Naranag village is also connected with the same Highway. The trek can be done in both ways, but to escape the direct Sun it is recommended to commence the trek at Sonamarg and end at Naranag as it treks mostly in a westerly direction.",
      "The Great Lakes as the name suggests treks through many high altitude alpine lakes situated at the foothills of different snow-clad mountain peaks. The most famous lakes are Vishansar and Gangabal Lakes. It crosses streams, plenty of colorful alpine meadows, and ascends three mountain passes with an average altitude of 4000m above sea level. The highest mountain peak of the trek which dominates the second part of the trek is Mount Haramukh standing at 5300 meters above sea level.",
      "The Great Lakes Trek expedition is no walk in the park. Arduous days, steep mountain passes, and altitudes approaching 4200m demand a sure-feet and a good amount of physical and mental fitness. The difficulties of the trek are rewarding and the challenges are worth it for the sense of achievement. This trek of the Kashmir is the most beautiful and most serene of all treks in the Himalayas.",

      "Sonamarg – Nichnai (7 hrs trek). After breakfast at the campsite, we pack our load and backpacks on horses and start our trek. Our trek is a slightly steep ascends the meadows and enters a pine/ birch forest at Shokdari. There’s a army check post where we have to produce our ID cards or passports. The process takes not more than 10 minutes to tally the ID’s with the trek-permits which we had acquired well in advance. The officials are very friendly and the short break is worth to have a distant sight of the Thajwas glacier and the vibrant Sonamarg town. We trek pine forest for 3 hours and have our lunch at Shokdari Top. After the lunch our trek enters birch forest a slight descend trek, very comforting in walking as we enter the vast and long Nichnai meadow. It takes another hour or two to reach our camping ground to have our tea or kahwa and finally the dinner and an overnight stay.",

      "  Nichnai – Vishnasar – Krishansar Lake (7 hrs trek). After the breakfast, we leave Nichnai meadow crossing a small icy-water stream, we start ascending one of the three passes of the trek the Nichnai Pass (4080m). The pass will test our legs and most importantly our stamina. The trek which takes an hour of some steep hiking looks never-ending. We ascend the pass through grazing pastures of sheep and goats. After crossing the pass we enter into the Vishansar Valley which is also called as “the valley of medicinal plants”, due to its sheer varieties of alpine flowery plants. We take our lunch and trek all the way down to Vishansar Lake. We take our tea or kahwa and the dinner at the campsite. Vishansar Lake is just a 10 minutes walk away from our campsite.",

      "Vishansar – Gadsar (8 hrs trek). After the breakfast, we start our day’s trek looking over and over to Vishansar Lake while we ascend to Krishansar Lake. The Krishansar Lake is a sibling of the former, it lies just over a ridge. We take its eastern shore to ascend the second and the highest pass of the trek the Gadsar Pass (4180m). The pass-trek is steeper than that of the Nichnai. It takes 2 hours to ascend the pass. On the top of the pass, we have the aerial view of the whole Vishansar valley among it are situated the twin lakes of Vishansar and Krishansar “the source of Neelam River”. We trek-down the Gadsar valley and take our lunch at the Gadsar Lake. The valley is also full of the flowery alpine plants and the green carpeted mountains look fabulous with their snow-clad tops. Our alpine pasture trek is full of Kashmir sheep, while walking down the trek it looks never ending as finally we arrive our camping ground at Kostour Kot. Before few years there used to have another army check-post, but luckily they are gone. Now no more checking at Gadsar. We take our tea or Kahwa and have our dinner at the evening.",

      "Gadsar – Satsar Lakes – Megandoab (5 hrs trek). After the breakfast we ascend Kostur Kout leaving Gadsar valley, it takes 2 hours of a trek to enter the meadow of Rasbal. At the Rasbal a flowing river disappears inside the boulders and flows underground. The trek follows a fertile meadow. We continue our trek through seven small lakes of Satsar and camp at Megandoab at the foothills of the third pass of Zajibal for an overnight stay. Today we take our lunch at the campsite as this is the shortest day of the trek.",

      "Satsar – Gangabal lake (6 hrs trek). After the breakfast at the campsite we start our trek by criss-crossing boulders. We ascend the last pass of our trek ‘Zajibal Pass (4080m)’. It takes maximum 3 hours of alpine trekking. As we reach atop, all our tiredness falls apart by looking at the views and the mountain scenery of the Mount Haramukh (5300m) just standing in the front and at its footsteps lie the twin beautiful alpine lakes of Gangabal and Nundkol. There is also a clear view os the distant Kolesar Lake. We descend the pass and reach our campsite at Gangabal Lake for an overnight stay. We take our lunch at the lake and tea and dinner at the campsite.",

Being the organizers of the trek, acquiring trek-permits was the most challenging part of the trek; as the base camp lies close to the Line of Control. Kashmir Treks started an era opening this trek for many to come.",
      "Gurez Valley is the beautiful amalgamation of mountains, a valley, and a river. It is a valley deep located in the high Himalayas, about 86 km from Bandipora near Wular Lake and 133 km from Srinagar in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir. Gurez was part of ancient Dardistan, stretching from Sharada Peeth in the west, Minimarg over Burzil Pass in the north, Drass in the east, and Baghtor in the south. The Gurez Valley falls along the section of the ancient Silk Route, which connected the Kashmir Valley with Gilgit continuing further to Kashgar. At present, the valley is divided by the Line of Control between India and Pakistan, Minimarg along with the Burzil Pass lies in the Pakistani side, and Dawar and Tulail lie on the Indian side.",

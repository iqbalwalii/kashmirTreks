    introduction: [
      "The Kashmir Great Lakes Trek is a moderate hiking trail in the western Himalayas of the Kashmir region. The base-camp Sonamarg lies on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. The ending point Naranag village is also connected with the same Highway. The trek can be done in both ways, but to escape the direct Sun it is recommended to commence the trek at Sonamarg and end at Naranag as it treks mostly in a westerly direction.",
      "The Great Lakes as the name suggests treks through many high altitude alpine lakes situated at the foothills of different snow-clad mountain peaks. The most famous lakes are Vishansar and Gangabal Lakes. It crosses streams, plenty of colorful alpine meadows, and ascends three mountain passes with an average altitude of 4000m above sea level. The highest mountain peak of the trek which dominates the second part of the trek is Mount Haramukh standing at 5300 meters above sea level.",
      "The Great Lakes Trek expedition is no walk in the park. Arduous days, steep mountain passes, and altitudes approaching 4200m demand a sure-feet and a good amount of physical and mental fitness. The difficulties of the trek are rewarding and the challenges are worth it for the sense of achievement. This trek of the Kashmir is the most beautiful and most serene of all treks in the Himalayas.",

We have a tea or kahwa before the dinner at the evening. The drive through Ganderbal villages takes maximum 3 hours to cover a distance of around 100 kms. Sonamarg is the last town with a market before the start of the trek.",

      "Sonamarg – Nichnai (7 hrs trek). After breakfast at the campsite, we pack our load and backpacks on horses and start our trek. Our trek is a slightly steep ascends the meadows and enters a pine/ birch forest at Shokdari. There’s a army check post where we have to produce our ID cards or passports. The process takes not more than 10 minutes to tally the ID’s with the trek-permits which we had acquired well in advance. The officials are very friendly and the short break is worth to have a distant sight of the Thajwas glacier and the vibrant Sonamarg town. We trek pine forest for 3 hours and have our lunch at Shokdari Top. After the lunch our trek enters birch forest a slight descend trek, very comforting in walking as we enter the vast and long Nichnai meadow. It takes another hour or two to reach our camping ground to have our tea or kahwa and finally the dinner and an overnight stay.",

      "  Nichnai – Vishnasar – Krishansar Lake (7 hrs trek). After the breakfast, we leave Nichnai meadow crossing a small icy-water stream, we start ascending one of the three passes of the trek the Nichnai Pass (4080m). The pass will test our legs and most importantly our stamina. The trek which takes an hour of some steep hiking looks never-ending. We ascend the pass through grazing pastures of sheep and goats. After crossing the pass we enter into the Vishansar Valley which is also called as “the valley of medicinal plants”, due to its sheer varieties of alpine flowery plants. We take our lunch and trek all the way down to Vishansar Lake. We take our tea or kahwa and the dinner at the campsite. Vishansar Lake is just a 10 minutes walk away from our campsite.",

      "Vishansar – Gadsar (8 hrs trek). After the breakfast, we start our day’s trek looking over and over to Vishansar Lake while we ascend to Krishansar Lake. The Krishansar Lake is a sibling of the former, it lies just over a ridge. We take its eastern shore to ascend the second and the highest pass of the trek the Gadsar Pass (4180m). The pass-trek is steeper than that of the Nichnai. It takes 2 hours to ascend the pass. On the top of the pass, we have the aerial view of the whole Vishansar valley among it are situated the twin lakes of Vishansar and Krishansar “the source of Neelam River”. We trek-down the Gadsar valley and take our lunch at the Gadsar Lake. The valley is also full of the flowery alpine plants and the green carpeted mountains look fabulous with their snow-clad tops. Our alpine pasture trek is full of Kashmir sheep, while walking down the trek it looks never ending as finally we arrive our camping ground at Kostour Kot. Before few years there used to have another army check-post, but luckily they are gone. Now no more checking at Gadsar. We take our tea or Kahwa and have our dinner at the evening.",

      "Gadsar – Satsar Lakes – Megandoab (5 hrs trek). After the breakfast we ascend Kostur Kout leaving Gadsar valley, it takes 2 hours of a trek to enter the meadow of Rasbal. At the Rasbal a flowing river disappears inside the boulders and flows underground. The trek follows a fertile meadow. We continue our trek through seven small lakes of Satsar and camp at Megandoab at the foothills of the third pass of Zajibal for an overnight stay. Today we take our lunch at the campsite as this is the shortest day of the trek.",

      "Satsar – Gangabal lake (6 hrs trek). After the breakfast at the campsite we start our trek by criss-crossing boulders. We ascend the last pass of our trek ‘Zajibal Pass (4080m)’. It takes maximum 3 hours of alpine trekking. As we reach atop, all our tiredness falls apart by looking at the views and the mountain scenery of the Mount Haramukh (5300m) just standing in the front and at its footsteps lie the twin beautiful alpine lakes of Gangabal and Nundkol. There is also a clear view os the distant Kolesar Lake. We descend the pass and reach our campsite at Gangabal Lake for an overnight stay. We take our lunch at the lake and tea and dinner at the campsite.",

      "Gangabal – Naranag. (6 hrs trek) – Srinagar (2 hours drive). We leave Gangabal and Nundkol Lakes and trek down the meadows of Trunkhol. We may need to produce our permits and show our ID cards at the Army check-post at the Trunkhol. We continue our trek down and enter the tree-line.

Being the organizers of the trek, acquiring trek-permits was the most challenging part of the trek; as the base camp lies close to the Line of Control. Kashmir Ensueno started an era opening this trek for many to come.",
      "Gurez Valley is the beautiful amalgamation of mountains, a valley, and a river. It is a valley deep located in the high Himalayas, about 86 km from Bandipora near Wular Lake and 133 km from Srinagar in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir. Gurez was part of ancient Dardistan, stretching from Sharada Peeth in the west, Minimarg over Burzil Pass in the north, Drass in the east, and Baghtor in the south. The Gurez Valley falls along the section of the ancient Silk Route, which connected the Kashmir Valley with Gilgit continuing further to Kashgar. At present, the valley is divided by the Line of Control between India and Pakistan, Minimarg along with the Burzil Pass lies in the Pakistani side, and Dawar and Tulail lie on the Indian side.",

The trail climbs swiftly past a few Gujjar huts to the camping grounds of Sekhwas. Camp for the night at Sekhwas.",

      "Shekwas to Tarsar. It is a gentle climb to Tarsar through tall grasses, a few ridges and finally to the shore of the lake. Tarsar Lake is 5 km above Sekhwas and takes 4 hours with an altitude gain of 518 meters. The turquoise blue water is surrounded by lush meadows and snow capped peaks – this campsite is truly heaven on earth. Camp at Tarsar for an overnight stay.",

      "Tarsar to Sundersar. The trek to Sundersar covers a distance of 5 km in 5 hours with a pass crossing. Some trekkers attempt a trek to Marsar, which is a closed lake set inside a cauldron with steep sides. The trail is a steep ascent in the beginning, followed by a descent and then a final gentle ascent to the beautiful Sundarsar a small lake. Around the lake are long meadow stretches with little sprouting flowers of yellow, blue and white. Sundarsar has big, flat stretches that is a perfect camping spot.",

      "Visit Marsar, and get down to Sonamasti. The trail initially is a climb to Marsar, which is at an altitude of 4100m. We explore the surrounding meadows, and finally descend to 3400m. The trek covers a distance of approximately 8 km in 6 hours. The Sonamasti valley is a sharp drop of over 600m, over a series of meadows. Each of these meadows has a little stream that runs down from snow melts and falls down to the meadow below forming a clear pond, before sliding off the cliff as a waterfall. The Sonamasti valley floor, again, is a breathtaking piece of nature’s art with small streams, brooks and green pastures. Camp for the night at Sonamasti",

      " Sonamasti to Sumbal. Drive to Srinagar. Descend 1370m, and 11 km from Sonamasti to Surfraw. An early start will get us to Sumbal is about 5 hours. The trek ends at Surfraw Sumbal. It is a 3 hour drive from Sumbal to Srinagar.",

      "On arrival at Leh airport, you will be met by our representative who will transfer you to the hotel. Overnight stay.",

      "Leh- Zingchen- Rumbak 4000 m (5 hours trek): We drive from Leh to Spituk and continue on a dirt jeep road into a parched and exposed region. After about an hour’s drive, we will enter the Zingchen Valley where the Rumbak River flows into the Indus which makes its way down a mighty canyon. Further into the valley lies a beautiful village of Rumbak, inhabited by 15 families.",

      "Rumbak – Ganda La Base 4500 m (3-4 hours): From Rumbak it’s a short walk to our next camp, but a very important one in terms of acclimatization, as we will camp very high tonight and cross the high pass the next day. So, we will not hurry and take our time to reach the camp at the base of Ganda La. After a short walk from the camp, we will come across the village of Yuruche, inhabited by only 1 family. From our campsite, there are spectacular views of Stok Kangri and the whole Stok range.",

      "Ganda La base – Skiu via Ganda La 6-7 hours: After a light breakfast, we will begin our 2-hour ascent towards Ganda La (4900m). The usual Chorten and prayer flags mark the top of the pass, where one may see blue sheep, marmots and argali roaming the hills around. Views of the lofty Zanskar Range and the distant Himalaya Range are great as well. After a short rest, we will make a gradual descent to Shingo and break for lunch. We will finish the day by hiking for 2-hours through a spectacular gorge before making camp at Skiu (3300m). Within this idyllic village lies an old monastery and ruins of an old castle, once a rest stop for the Royal family on their way to Srinagar.",

      "Skiu – Markha (8 hours trek: Following the Markha River, we will hike through the lovely valley on a fairly level path. The trail crosses the river at various points and passes winter settlements that contain Lhatos (religious shrines for local deities) and Mani walls (stones inscribed with Buddhist prayers). During peak season several tented teahouses will be open for refreshment. Markha (3800m) is the largest village in the valley, consisting of around 20 houses, an old monastery, and a ruined fort.",

      " Markha – Thachungtse (6 hours trek): The Markha valley trail continues past old stone-mills, a ruined castle, and the auspicious monastery of Techa, which proudly perches upon a cliff that looms above Markha. The path then intersects the river several times before cutting through the last hamlets in the valley. After leaving the village of Umlung, we will be afforded our first view of mighty Mt. Kang Yatse (6400m), which will stay in sight until we cross Kongmaru La. After we break for lunch in the village of Hangkar (the last one in the valley), we will continue onward to the lovely green pasture of Thachungste (4100m), where we will make camp.",

      "Thachungtse – Nimaling (4 hours trek): Today the trail will lead us up to the beautiful plateau of Nimaling, where the people of the Markha Valley bring their herds to graze during the summer months. At 4700m, Nimaling is the highest camp (4600m) on the trek, giving us spectacular views of the huge peak of Kang Yatse to the right.",

      "Nimaling – Shangsumdo via Kongmaru La (7 hours trek): After a hearty breakfast, we will cross Kongmaru La (5200m), the highest pass on the trek, and from here we will have a wonderful view of the Indus Valley and Ladakh Range. The descent is quite steep, but will gradually level out as we enter Shang Gorge, with its fascinating rock formations. More river crossings bar our way before we arrive at the sour-spring of Chuskurmo (used in traditional medicine by the Amchi doctors). Camp overnight in Shang Sumdo.",

      "Shangsumdo – Leh via Martselang: We will enjoy a pleasant 2-hour walk along a jeep road to Martselang, where the jeep will pick us up. On the way to Leh, it will be possible to visit some of the great monasteries of Ladakh such as Thikse, Hemis, and Shey.",

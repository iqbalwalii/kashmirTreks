      "Summer is prime time for walking, trekking, and climbing in the mountains. It offers a good flow of water in rivers to raft. It provides pretty good village roads covered in by Chinar shades for cycling.",
      "Summers in the Himalaya mostly provide stable, warm weather. The main alpine summer season is from mid-June to mid-September. All the mountain treks are open during this period. In June, the weather is not too hot and there is a lot of snow left on the mountain peaks and glaciers to provide a cool breeze. July and August are by far the busiest and have the warmest and most stable weather. It’s not uncommon that temperatures exceed 30C. In September, things get quieter again and the temperatures get cooler. Of course, there’s never any guarantee when it comes to rain in Kashmir.",

Some of the bowls of the summit have a straight 1,200 meters of thigh-destroying vertical descent!",

              Kashmir Ensueno respects your privacy and recognizes the need to
              protect the personally identifiable information (any information
              by which you can be identified, such as name, address, email, and
              telephone number) you share with us. We would like to assure you
              that we follow appropriate standards when it comes to protecting
              your privacy on our web sites.
              <br />
              <br />
              We assure you that we at Kashmir Ensueno take all reasonable
              measures to maintain your privacy and security regarding personal
              information that you voluntarily divulge to us. We take this
              seriously! During the course of communication and or tour
              reservations, we collect information that you voluntarily disclose
              to us, including but not limited to name, address, phone, and
              email. This information may come to us from an associated third
              party, such as a person who is the primary organizer or contact
              person of a group, or from a travel agent. KT may choose to retain
              such information in its database. We may utilize, within the
              company, such information for our occasional mailings, email
              notices, or even phone calls for the purposes of advancing the
              program of KT.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, we will not share or sell that information with any other
              company/entity for commercial purposes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, we will not collect from your personal computer or
              any other source, additional information about you beyond what you
              have voluntarily given to us.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are some limited circumstances in which we may have to
              disclose your information: if required by law or if we are
              required to do so by law-enforcement authorities, or if we believe
              in good faith that the information you have provided us is
              necessary to disclose to the appropriate authorities for the
              protection of rights, property, or safety of our company and its
              users.

              KT uses state of the art efforts to secure the confidentiality of
              your personal information. Unfortunately, internet security is not
              perfect. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or
              access transmissions or private communications. Please use
              appropriate caution before you disclose personal information to
              any internet site, and realize that some companies take ensuring
              your privacy much more seriously than others.

              expenses, air ambulance, loss of effects, repatriation costs, and
              all other expenses which might arise as a result of loss, damage,
              injury delay, or inconvenience occurring to the client. It is
              compulsory that all clients have personal travel insurance. When

              KT’s trek itineraries have been designed to provide participants
              with an exposure to the true nature of the environment visited and
              therefore involve an element of personal risk and exposure to
              potential hazards over and above those associated with normal

              tour is adventurous and that such activities may involve a
              significant amount of personal risk. We advise you to read and

              Due to political and cultural differences, as well as generally
              tougher physical conditions, travel to the areas we visit involves
              risks other than those we take in our daily lives. It is important
              clients make themselves aware of the risks involved, and are
              responsible for making their travel plans accordingly.
